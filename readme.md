# RJ'S Guitar Practice Routine

_Exercises for improving fluency on guitar_

&nbsp;

## What is this book?

This is a book of exercises for levelling up fretboard skills. More specifically, this book aims to improve the following technical skills:
- string crossings
- position shifts
- chord movement
- harmonic context

## Who is this for?

Intermediate-level guitarists that want a good starting point for a daily practice regimen.

## How do I use this?

### Daily practice

For example, a simple daily session could involve playing one exercise from part 1, and
another from part 2. If I have more time, I can go through an exercise from each part as a technical exercise or warmup,

### Brushing up on technique

You can also focus on specific exercises. Say you want to improve your chord work for a
week. Then you can play one exercise from Part 3 every day for a week.

### Examples of daily exercise programs

BASIC ROUTINE --- 1 exercise from each of the following parts: 1, 2  
EXTENDED ROUTINE --- 1 exercise from each of the following parts: 1, 2, 3  
FOCUSED ROUTINE --- all the exercises from one part  

## Why did you write this?

This book started as a personal collection of exercises to get better at improvising on guitar, but it turned into a compact system that could help other guitarists as well. So I cleaned up what exercises I had, and decided to share this with others.

I hope you learn something cool here, because I learned a lot by making it.
