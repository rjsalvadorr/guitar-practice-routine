# Guitar Improv Foundations

_Exercises for improving fluency on guitar_

## Notes

- Add a place for notation basics?
  + fingering indications
  + barre indications

## Feedback from Brian

- Suggestion for modes: Play the tonic as a drone, to really hear the differences between the modes.
- More encouragement!!! You kinda know your audience. Just encourage the shit out of them.

## Test run on Paulo

- The chords need fingerings. They're super confusing at first, and indicators might help.

## Preface

### What is this book?

This book started as a personal collection of exercises to get better at improvising on guitar, but it turned into a compact system that could help other guitarists as well. So I cleaned up what exercises I had, and decided to share this with others.

I've laid out exercises for improving guitar fluency, which help the reader to memorize patterns on the fingerboard.
These patterns all build on each other, and are especially effective when combined with music theory knowledge.

I hope you learn something cool here, because I learned a lot by making it.

### Who is this book for, and why should anyone use it?

If any of this describes you, you might find this book useful:

- You want to get better at improvisation by building up your technique and dexterity.
- You like playing through fingerstyle or hybrid picking.
- You want to learn things that you can use immediately.
- You don't like a rigid practice regimen, and want something more free-form.

### What should a guitarist know before using this book?

Not very much. If you can play at a basic level, and you can read tablature, you can probably learn a lot here.

### How does a guitarist use this properly?

#### The general rule

For any exercise, learn the chord patterns until you can play the the whole exercise smoothly. That means playing the correct notes, in correct and steady rhythm. If you can do this, you're _doing it right_.

Once you learn the chord patterns, **play with them**. Use them to play familiar chords in different ways. Mix the new chord patterns with older and more familiar ways of playing guitar. This way, you'll learn what works for you, and what doesn't work as well.

#### Specific guidelines

1. Focus on memorizing the chord patterns relative to their root note. If you learn one chord pattern on the fretboard, you can easily that same chord type on different root notes.
1. At first, play through the chord patterns slowly. This is really important. It's easier to memorize these patterns when they're played slowly, and it's the quicker way to build comfortable habits for your hands.
1. Don't worry if you can't memorize the chord patterns quickly. It takes plenty of time and repetition to build muscle memory. That's why you have to do this stuff frequently, hopefully every day. Just 10 minutes a day could work. Besides, even if you don't memorize an exercise completely, you'd still build finger dexterity by doing it.

## Chapter 1 - Arpeggios

Arpeggios are an essential element for skillful improvisation and composition. They're used in countless melodies, and many accompaniment parts use nothing but block chords and arpeggios.

I put these exercises first because they're so useful,
versatile, and ubiquitous. Knowledge of arpeggios can be applied right away to create good music. If you're going to learn only one exercise set from this book, this is the one I'd recommend.

### Exercise Format

Each exercise goes through a chord progression made of four chords, which are played as two-octave arpeggios.

### Suggestions

Be mindful of the root note of each chord, and where they are. Each arpeggio in these exercises will have the root note in three spots: the beginning, middle, and end.

Follow the fretting hand fingerings on the notation staff.
If you're not familiar with the notation, the fingers are numbered like this:

1 = index  
2 = middle  
3 = ring  
4 = pinky

## Chapter 2 - Scales & modes

Many guitarists encounter scales and modes as the mainstays of boring practice routines. Well, they're also the mainstays of effective practice routines. And they don't have to be boring, if you know how to apply them properly.
Scale practice improves the skills needed for lightning-fast runs, and staying in key while improvising melodies.

This chapter will cover the seven diatonic modes in Western Music:

1. Ionian mode _(widely known as the Major Scale)_
1. Dorian mode
1. Phrygian mode
1. Lydian mode
1. Mixolydian mode
1. Aeolian mode _(a.k.a. the Natural minor scale)_
1. Locrian mode

If you don't know what modes are, this chapter may be challenging for you. In that case, you can still do the exercises and worry about the theory stuff after. Your fingers can learn the scales & modes before your brain does, and things will 'click' once you learn the theoretical concepts behind modes. Even if you have familiarity with these concepts, the exercises should help you play them more fluently.

Similar to the previous chapter, we'll be practicing scale movements through chord progressions. Since there are so many modes and multiple ways to go through them, this chapter contains the most exercises in the book. It's a lot of material, but definitely worth the effort. This might sound far-fetched, but scales are very effective for building just about any guitar-related skill when adapted properly. (Some of these adaptations will be covered in chapter 3).

### Exercise 2A

In the major key, the _ionian_, _lydian_, and _mixolydian_
modes start on the 1st, 4th, and 5th scale degrees
(respectively).

### Exercise 2B

The same modes as in Exercise 2-A, but with the _lydian_
and _mixolydian_ modes below the _ionian_.

### Exercise 2C

In the natural minor key, the _aeolian_, _dorian_, and
_phrygian_ modes start on the 1st, 4th, and 5th scale degrees (respectively).

### Exercise 2D

The same modes as in Exercise 2-C, but with the _dorian_
and _phrygian_ modes below the _aeolian_.

### Exercise 2E

Mixed modes. Introducing the diminished mode: _locrian_,
starting on the low E string.

### Exercise 2F

Mixed modes, with the _locrian_ mode starting on the A string.

## Chapter 3 - Scale & Arpeggio Variations

Together, scales and arpeggios form the backbone of a serious guitarist's practice regimen. But they suffer from a serious drawback. They can become real boring when practiced the same way over and over again.

Boredom can make music practice less effective, and even worse: boredom can lead to quitting practice altogether.
Scale & arpeggio variations can keep that boredom from wasting your time, and can even help you find new ways of playing.

## Chapter 4 - Three-string chord voicings

Three-string voicings are a great way to add some harmony to a melodic passage. Technically, they're also pretty efficient. Your fretting hand can form these chord shapes quickly, and you can move through most chords while barely moving your hand around the neck.

Learning these chord shapes can give your solos a fuller sound by supporting the melody with harmony. They also make it easier to transition between melodic and rhythmic playing.

### Exercise Format

Each exercise shows how to play one chord type through the upper, middle, and lower strings. Every given chord is played in different inversions:

\- root note on top  
\- 3rd on top  
\- 5th on top  

The exercises don't have any chords written on the bottom three strings. Those were left out because chord patterns using the 5th, 4th, and 3rd strings (or A, D, and G) can be used on the three bottom strings as well.

### Suggestions 

Try to make melodies with these chords, paying attention to the note at the top of each chord.

## Chapter 5 - Open chord voicings

Classical and jazz guitarists are known for playing chords with plenty of space between the notes. These are usually played fingerstyle with the right hand. The thumb would hit the bass string, and the index, middle, or ring fingers would strike the upper strings.

Learning these voicings should give you the skills for playing on two areas of the fretboard at the same time.
With enough practice, you can easily play a distinct bassline with a melody (plus accompaniment) all by yourself.
